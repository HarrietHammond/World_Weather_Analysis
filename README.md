# World_Weather_Analysis
Using weather description data to enhance an app (PlanMyTrip app) is the goal of this activity. We will use (beta tester) input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta tester will choose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, we will create a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.

What Is being created:

Three technical analyses:

Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data

Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map

Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
